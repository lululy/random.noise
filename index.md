## [Stay Strong]Things I Learned Recently
- Focus on what I can do, rather than how I feel. 
- Focusing on negative feeling won't solve the problem and makes myself feel worse.

## [Journal Article Writing]Things I Learned Recently
1. Don't be a perfectionist in writing joural article. 

- Start writing immediately, once you have an idea. Don't wait until you read every piece of paper that is related to the subject. 
- Read literature depends on what you need to finish the paper. It is impossible to put every literature to a 8k words. 

2. Write as much as possible. The most straight forward way to write a lot of paper is to ***start*** writing a paper **now**. 
- You need to write every day to keep track on the project. Start a writing journal.
